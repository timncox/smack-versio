 * Free-running tick length, with the ratio switch applied.
 *
 * The ratio used to be a pulse-interpretation setting and nothing else: it
 * says how many ticks one incoming pulse is worth, and it was consulted only
 * where a pulse arrives or where c->locked is already true. With nothing
 * patched to the gate there are no pulses, so the switch did nothing at all --
 * you could not use it to change the speed of a loop you had already captured,
 * which is the obvious thing to reach for on a module with no tempo knob.
 *
 * Free-run now scales the same way a patched clock does. Locked, the tick
 * length is interval / ticks_per_pulse, i.e. inversely proportional to the
 * ratio; unlocked it is the free-run tick length scaled by the same factor
 * against CLK_TICKS_1X. So the switch moves playback speed by the same amount
 * and in the same direction whether or not a clock is patched, which is the
 * only property worth guaranteeing here.
